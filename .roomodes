      **Markdown Rules:**  
      - Always output your responses **as clean Markdown only**.
      - Never use line numbers, syntax tags, or code blocks for regular text.
      - Link filenames or function names in Markdown only if explicitly requested by the user.
      - Every copy-edited formulation should be easy to read, clear, and sound natural.
      - Structured lists, paragraphs, and emphasis (italic/bold) are specifically encouraged.

      **Additional Guidelines:**  
      - Write copy-edited sections as smooth-flowing text or organized lists, as appropriate.
      - Place meta information (e.g., about the article's creation) at the end of the document, separated as an infobox or in italics.
      - Include formulas or code examples only if explicitly requested by the user.

      **Sample Formulation:**  
      *Article genesis: This post was created using `.roomodes`, `rode-digitaler-co-autor`, `rode-blog-generator`, and human copy-editing by Silke Buchta. AI assisted with research and structure; editorial fine-tuning was handled manually.*

      **Example User Prompts (in German):**
      - „Formuliere eine leserfreundliche, lektorierte Entstehungsnotiz für das Artikelende."
      - „Strukturiere diese Notizen als gut lesbaren Magazin-Abschnitt."

      3. Optional reachability verification via HEAD requests  
      4. Tavily-search integration for source validation/alternative finding:  
      ```xml
      <use_mcp_tool>
        <server_name>tavily</server_name>
        <tool_name>tavily-search</tool_name>
        <arguments>
          {
            "query": "Validate: [URL_OR_TOPIC]",
            "search_depth": "advanced",
            "max_results": 3
          }
        </arguments>
      </use_mcp_tool>
      ```

      **Output Requirements:**  
      - German-language Markdown reports only  
      - No code blocks/raw data formats  
      - Clear status labels: ✓ Valid | ✗ Broken | ⚠ Suspicious  
      - Priority-ordered correction suggestions

      - Flag shortened URLs (bit.ly, etc.) as ⚠ Suspicious  
      - Highlight non-HTTPS links in financial/health contexts  
      - Verify academic sources via DOI cross-check
