### What is OpenCode?

OpenCode is a separate, powerful AI-powered development framework that provides:

- 🤖 **Intelligent Agents** for specialized development tasks
- 🔧 **Automated Workflows** that enforce best practices
- 🛡️ **Security-First Development** with built-in vulnerability detection
- 📊 **Comprehensive Testing** across all technology stacks
- 🚀 **CI/CD Integration** ready for any platform

OpenCode is available at https://opencode.ai/docs/ and must be installed separately to use with this template. Think of OpenCode as the engine that powers AI-assisted development.

### What is This Template?

This repository is a **best-practice template** for projects that want to leverage the OpenCode framework. It provides:

- Pre-configured agent definitions that tell OpenCode's agents how to behave
- Custom commands that orchestrate OpenCode's agents for specific tasks
- Plugins that extend OpenCode's automation capabilities
- Validation rules that define quality standards for OpenCode to enforce
- Sample application demonstrating how to structure projects for OpenCode

This template doesn't contain OpenCode itself, but rather provides an optimized structure and configuration for using OpenCode effectively in your projects. Think of this template as the vehicle that's designed to work with OpenCode's engine.

### How They Work Together

The relationship between OpenCode and this template is straightforward:

1. **OpenCode Framework**: Provides the core AI agents, automation engine, and development capabilities
2. **This Template**: Provides configuration files and structure that optimize how OpenCode works in your project

When you use this template:
- You still need to install OpenCode separately
- The template's configuration files tell OpenCode's agents how to behave
- The template's structure provides a best-practice organization for your code
- The template's plugins extend OpenCode's capabilities

This separation means you can use OpenCode with any project structure, but this template provides a proven, optimized starting point that gets the most out of OpenCode's capabilities.

## Template Architecture

### Template Structure

This template provides an optimized structure for projects using the OpenCode framework. The `.opencode` directory contains configurations that work with the OpenCode framework:

```
📦 Your Project/
├── ⚙️ .opencode/            # OpenCode Template Configuration
│   ├── 📂 agent/           # AI agent configurations
│   │   ├── 📂 common/      # Always-active agent configs
│   │   ├── 📂 domains/     # Domain-specific agent configs
│   │   ├── 📂 general/     # General-purpose agent configs
│   │   └── 📂 platforms/   # Platform-specific agent configs
│   ├── 📂 command/         # Custom command implementations
│   ├── 📂 docs/            # Template documentation
│   ├── 📂 eslint-plugins/  # Custom ESLint rules
│   ├── 📂 plugin/          # Template plugins
│   ├── 📂 scripts/         # Automation scripts
│   ├── 📂 tests/           # Template validation
│   └── 📂 validation/      # Validation rules and tools
└── 📂 src/                 # Sample application (demonstration only)
```

### How This Template Works with OpenCode

It's important to understand the distinction between this template and the OpenCode framework itself:

- **OpenCode Framework**: A separate project (https://opencode.ai/docs/) that provides the core AI-powered development assistance
- **This Template**: Provides an optimized structure and configuration for using the OpenCode framework effectively

The `.opencode` directory in this template contains configurations that work with the OpenCode framework:

- **Agent Definitions** (`.opencode/agent/`): Configuration files that define how OpenCode's agents should behave
- **Custom Commands** (`.opencode/command/`): Specialized commands that leverage OpenCode's agent orchestration
- **Plugins** (`.opencode/plugin/`): Automation tools that integrate with OpenCode's workflow system
- **Validation Rules** (`.opencode/validation/`): Quality standards that OpenCode's agents enforce
- **Sample Configuration**: Demonstrates best practices for OpenCode implementation

The `src` directory contains a sample application demonstrating how to use both the template structure and the OpenCode framework together.

This separation ensures that you can use the OpenCode framework with any project structure, while this template provides a best-practice starting point.

### Domain-Driven Design Implementation

This template implements **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles and provides configurations for OpenCode agents that help organize code by business domains rather than technical layers:

```
📦 Your Application (Recommended Structure)/
├── 📂 src/                    # Your application code
│   ├── 📂 domains/           # Business domains (recommended)
│   │   ├── 📂 app/          # Main application logic
│   │   ├── 📂 auth/         # Authentication
│   │   └── 📂 shared/       # Cross-domain code
│   ├── 📂 core/             # Core utilities
│   │   ├── 📂 config/       # Configuration
│   │   ├── 📂 types/        # Type definitions
│   │   └── 📂 utils/        # Helper functions
│   └── 📂 ui/               # UI components
└── ⚙️ .opencode/            # OpenCode Template Configuration
```

This architectural approach offers several advantages:

1. **Business-Aligned Structure**: Code organization mirrors business domains, making it easier for new team members to understand the system.
2. **Scalability**: New features can be added as separate domains without disrupting existing functionality.
3. **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries between domains reduce coupling and make the codebase easier to maintain.
4. **Team Organization**: Teams can be organized around domains, with clear ownership and responsibility.

### Multi-Platform Support

This template includes configurations for OpenCode to work seamlessly across different Git hosting platforms. The template includes dedicated support for:

- **GitHub**: Actions workflows and platform-specific tools

### Sequential Workflow

```bash
# Architecture → Implementation → Testing → Documentation
@common/agent-orchestrator "Design with @general/code-architect, implement with @domains/api/api-designer, test with @common/test-engineer, document with @common/documentation-maintainer"
```

### Parallel Processing

```bash
# Multiple agents working at once
@common/agent-orchestrator "Run parallel: @common/security-auditor for security, @common/performance-optimizer for speed, @common/code-reviewer for quality"
```

### Swarm Intelligence

```bash
# Agents share context and build on each other's work
@common/agent-orchestrator "Swarm mode: @domains/ui/ui-ux-designer, @general/code-architect, and @common/performance-optimizer for UI optimization"
```

This collaborative approach ensures that every aspect of development receives expert attention, from initial design to deployment and beyond.
