  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < array.length; j++) {
      if (array[i] === array[j]) {
        duplicates.push(array[i]);
      }
    }
  }
  return duplicates;
}

// Optimized version using Set
function findDuplicatesOptimized(array) {
  const seen = new Set();
  const duplicates = new Set();

  for (const item of array) {
    if (seen.has(item)) {
      duplicates.add(item);
    } else {
      seen.add(item);
    }
  }

  return Array.from(duplicates);
}
```

### Memory Optimization

```javascript
// Example: Memory-efficient data processing
class MemoryEfficientProcessor {
  constructor() {
    this.batchSize = 1000;
    this.results = [];
  }

  async processLargeDataset(dataset) {
    // Process in batches to avoid memory overload
    for (let i = 0; i < dataset.length; i += this.batchSize) {
      const batch = dataset.slice(i, i + this.batchSize);
      const batchResults = await this.processBatch(batch);

      // Process results immediately to free memory
      await this.saveResults(batchResults);
      this.results = []; // Clear results array
    }
  }

  async processBatch(batch) {
    // Process batch and return results
    return batch.map(item => this.transform(item));
  }

  async saveResults(results) {
