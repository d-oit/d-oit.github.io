## OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES

### Code-Level Optimizations

```javascript
// Example: Algorithm optimization
const optimizedSearch = (array, target) => {
  let left = 0;
  let right = array.length - 1;
  
  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
    if (array[mid] === target) return mid;
    if (array[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
    else right = mid - 1;
  }
  return -1;
};

// Example: Memory-efficient data structures
class MemoryEfficientCache {
  constructor(maxSize) {
    this.cache = new Map();
    this.maxSize = maxSize;
  }

  get(key) {
    if (this.cache.has(key)) {
      const value = this.cache.get(key);
      this.cache.delete(key);
      this.cache.set(key, value);
      return value;
    }
    return null;
  }

  set(key, value) {
    if (this.cache.has(key)) {
      this.cache.delete(key);
    } else if (this.cache.size >= this.maxSize) {
      const firstKey = this.cache.keys().next().value;
      this.cache.delete(firstKey);
    }
    this.cache.set(key, value);
  }
}
```

### Database Optimizations

```sql
-- Optimized query with proper indexing
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_posts_user_date ON posts(user_id, created_at DESC);

-- Optimized query
SELECT u.username, p.title, p.created_at
FROM users u
JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id
WHERE u.email = ?
  AND p.created_at >= ?
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Frontend Optimizations

```javascript
// Code splitting example
const HomePage = lazy(() => import('./pages/HomePage'));
const AboutPage = lazy(() => import('./pages/AboutPage'));

// Image optimization with lazy loading
import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

const OptimizedImage = ({ src, alt, placeholder }) => {
  const [isLoaded, setIsLoaded] = useState(false);
  const [isInView, setIsInView] = useState(false);
  const imgRef = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
      ([entry]) => {
        if (entry.isIntersecting) {
          setIsInView(true);
          observer.disconnect();
        }
      },
      { threshold: 0.1 }
    );

    if (imgRef.current) {
      observer.observe(imgRef.current);
    }

    return () => observer.disconnect();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div ref={imgRef} className="image-container">
      {!isLoaded && <div className="placeholder">{placeholder}</div>}
      {isInView && (
        <img
          src={src}
          alt={alt}
          onLoad={() => setIsLoaded(true)}
          style={{ display: isLoaded ? 'block' : 'none' }}
        />
