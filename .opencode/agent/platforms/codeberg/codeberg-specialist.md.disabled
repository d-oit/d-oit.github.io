- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}` - Repository operations
- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues` - Issues
- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls` - Pull requests
- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/user/keys` - SSH keys

### Best Practices

1. **Authentication**: Always use access tokens, never passwords
2. **Scopes**: Request minimal required token scopes
3. **Rate Limits**: Be aware of API rate limits (5000 requests/hour for authenticated users)
4. **Pagination**: Use pagination for large result sets
5. **Webhooks**: Use webhooks for real-time updates
6. **Security**: Store tokens securely, rotate regularly
