## CI/CD PIPELINE DESIGN

### Pipeline Stages and Quality Gates

```yaml
ci_cd_pipeline_structure:
  stages:
    1. trigger: Code commit, PR creation, tag push, manual trigger
    2. build: Code compilation, dependency installation, artifact creation
    3. test: Unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests, security scans
    4. quality: Code coverage, linting, static analysis, performance tests
    5. security: Vulnerability scanning, dependency checks, security tests
    6. package: Docker image building, artifact packaging, documentation
    7. deploy: Deployment to staging, production, rollback procedures
    8. monitor: Health checks, performance monitoring, alerting

  quality_gates:
    - Code review approval required for merge
    - Minimum test coverage threshold (80%)
    - No critical security vulnerabilities
    - Successful build and all tests passing
    - Performance benchmarks met
    - Manual approval for production deployment
```
