# AI-Driven Development with OpenCode

This comprehensive guide focuses on modern AI-driven approaches for creating agents, commands, and plugins within the OpenCode framework. Drawing from industry best practices and AI agent development patterns, this guide emphasizes simplicity, composability, and human-AI collaboration.

## AI-First Development Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic LLM calls and add complexity only when needed
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Design systems that augment human capabilities, not replace them
- **Composability**: Build modular components that work together seamlessly
- **Transparency**: Make AI decision-making processes visible and understandable
- **Iterative Refinement**: Use feedback loops to continuously improve AI components

### When to Use AI-Driven Approaches
- **Complex Problem Solving**: Tasks requiring creative solutions or multi-step reasoning
- **Dynamic Workflows**: Processes that can't be easily predefined or hardcoded
- **Knowledge-Intensive Tasks**: Work requiring access to large amounts of information
- **Adaptive Systems**: Applications that need to learn and adapt over time

## AI Agent Development Patterns

### 1. Augmented LLM (Foundation Pattern)
