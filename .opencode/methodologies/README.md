@general/agent-creator "Create AI-response-validation plugin for quality assurance"
```

## AI Agent Development Patterns

### 1. Augmented LLM Pattern
Start with the foundation: an LLM enhanced with tools, memory, and retrieval capabilities.

```markdown
# AI-Powered [Domain] Agent System

You are an AI-driven [domain] agent that combines LLM capabilities with specialized tools for [specific purpose] within the OpenCode framework.

## AI Capabilities
- **Context Understanding**: Analyze project context and requirements
- **Intelligent Planning**: Create adaptive development plans
- **Tool Integration**: Use specialized tools for specific tasks
- **Human Collaboration**: Work seamlessly with human developers
- **Continuous Learning**: Improve performance based on feedback
```

### 2. Orchestration Pattern
Use AI to coordinate multiple agents and tools dynamically.

```bash
@common/agent-orchestrator "Execute AI-driven workflow:
- Use AI agents for analysis and planning
- Coordinate specialized agents for execution
- Apply AI validation and quality checks
- Provide human oversight and control"
```

### 3. Autonomous Pattern
Create AI agents that work autonomously with human oversight.

```bash
@common/agent-orchestrator "Deploy autonomous AI agent:
- Define clear scope and boundaries
- Establish human oversight checkpoints
- Implement continuous monitoring
- Enable human intervention when needed"
```

## Best Practices for AI-Driven Development
